					<p><a href="http://wethos.co/">Wethos</a> is the first freelance platform built specifically for nonprofits and socially conscious businesses, allowing you to find, source, and hire individual contractors that believe in your mission.</p>
					<p>After packing my bags from California to New York City, I initially came on as the Senior Product Designers; however, after learning about the needs and challenges of the organization I grabbed a couple more hats and assumed the role as the Lead Product Manager. </p>

					<p>I ran the full product spectrum from user research to product design to product prioritization, planning sprints and ensuring deliverables were shipped. I worked with the team to make significant improvements to not only our product and what we were building, but profoundly throughout the whole organization - with leading an Agile workshop and establishing an Agile product development process, constructing a product roadmap with input/collaboration from the whole team, setting up a JIRA board and properly tracking engineering tasks, establishing OKRs, and working with Rachel, our CEO, to understand our business and user insights to inform product decisions.</p>
					<p>The biggest skill I developed was tackling challenges of an organization <b>holistically</b> while also empowering and working cross-functionally with team members to get into the weeds to strategize how to overcome individual humps and obstacles along the way. </p>
					<p>It's great to have the opportunity to touch and contribute tremendous value to every part of the business - left to right, top to bottom. And most importantly, to work along with people who are truly talented and purpose-driven.</p>
