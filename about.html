     <p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area, but I didn't write my first line of code until right before I finished high school. I was motivated by the fact I could build anything I had in mind. This <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/nKIu9yen5nc">Code.org video</a> actually inspired me to pursue this as a career. My late teens were spent going through tutorials online and Codecademy.</p>

   <p>As a Computer Science Major at UC Davis, I attended tons of hackathons and built apps, websites and projects. Being creative and product-focused, I naturally gravitated towards front-end development and product design. Soon after that, I came to learn more about product design and how it's about problem-solving, not just making things look pretty.</p>

   <p>My junior year I co-founded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackdavis.io">HackDavis</a>, the first major collegiate hackathon at our university. I started HackDavis because most hackathons lack projects with purpose. HackDavis was social-good hackathon with three tracks: health/wellness, education and environment. Our 2016 event was super successful with over 300+ participants, a 50:50 gender ratio, and $6000 donated to charity!<a target="_blank" href="https://theaggie.org/2016/05/18/hackdavis-students-use-their-hacking-powers-for-good/"> Read about it!</a></p>

    <p>This last summer I worked as Design and Front-End Intern at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.connect.com">Connect</a>, a platform to make everyday events with friends seamless and inspiring. One of the projects I was most proud of was designing and coding the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.connect.com">landing page.</a> I also learned an incredible amount from how to successfully conduct user research, usability tests and test prototypes. Being part of this close, scrappy startup family was one the best experiences I've ever had!</p>

    <p>Currently I'm working as the Lead Product Manager at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wethos.co">Wethos</a>, a platform to connect nonprofits to freelance talent. After packing my bags from California to New York City, I initially came on as the Senior Product Designers; however, after learning about the needs and challenges of the organization I grabbed a couple more hats and assumed the role as the Lead Product Manager. I run the full product spectrum from user research to product design to product prioritization, planning sprints and ensuring deliverables were shipped. I've worked with the team to make significant improvements to not only our product and what we were building, but profoundly throughout the whole organization - with leading an Agile workshop and establishing an Agile product development process, constructing a product roadmap with input/collaboration from the whole team, setting up a JIRA board and properly tracking engineering tasks, establishing OKRs, and working with Rachel, our CEO, to understand our business and user insights to inform product decisions.</p>
